CCD

source files: ccd.cpp

Programme takes 2 numeric arguments and 3 files as input. It can
either be given file names on the command line or read the files
from STDIN.

If providing files, provide one file for each of the following:
  N-terminal anchor
  loop+terminals
  C-terminal anchor

If reading from STDIN, all of this is in one block of text.
Separate the three things by a line containing only a "#" symbol.

Test files are provided. Just run test.sh
